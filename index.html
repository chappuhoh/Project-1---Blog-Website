              Born on Jan 14, 2020, The Building Blog started as an idea between Scott and Ellen as a place to share their love, thoughts and opinion of LEGO for readers everywhere. We want TBB to be a place for the Adult Fans of Lego (known
              worldwide as AFOLs) of Perth to have somewhere to share their love of the hobby.
          </p>
          <p>LEGO is one of the most popular, and best-selling, toys of all time and is a household name all over the world. It’s fun for children and adults of all ages and has an incredible history dating back over 80 years.</p>
          <h3>Fun Lego Facts</h3>
          <p>We at the building blog love some fun facts. Check these out!</p>
          <ul>
              <li>The LEGO minifigure, also known as “minifig” or just “fig” was first introduced in 1978. The early figures before this, in 1975, had no facial features, gender, arms, or moveable legs.</li>
              <li>Each LEGO minifigure is exactly four bricks high without a hat.</li>
              <li>Since the first minifigure in 1978 more than 4 billion have been made. This makes LEGO them the world’s largest population group (if they were alive)!</li>
              <li>As of 2013, over 560 billion LEGO parts have been produced. On average, that is 86 LEGO bricks for every single person on the earth.</li>
              <li>LEGO is the world’s largest producer of rubber wheels. They produce more than Bridgestone, Goodyear and all other car tyre manufacturers.</li>

                  The rumour mill went into overdrive when LEGO teased a mini-Castle in the designer interview, and fans were expecting LEGO to give a classic LEGO Castle the full 18+/Creator Expert treatment, but turns out, LEGO had other
                  plans, and here we have this year’s 31120 Medieval Castle, which sits within the Creator 3-in-1 theme.

                  When LEGO introduced the Ninjago theme back in 2011, no one could have guessed that it would come to be one of the company’s most popular themes. Now celebrating its 10th anniversary, Ninjago is getting its biggest set yet,
                  71741 Ninjago City Gardens.
              </p>
              <p>At a whopping <b>5,685</b> pieces, it’s the <u>fifth-largest</u> LEGO set ever, and the third entry into the cyberpunk modular buildings collection known as Ninjago City.</blockquote></p>
